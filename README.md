Hey, I’m XD — a blockchain engineer focused on low-level systems, privacy tech, and quantum-resistant cryptography. I’m currently building **[QuantaChain](https://quantachain.org)**, a Rust-based quantum-resistant Layer-1 blockchain. I’m open to collaborating on protocol design, consensus research, or early-stage blockchain projects — feel free to reach out on **[Telegram](https://t.me/Idcidkidgfa)** if you’re working on something cool.
